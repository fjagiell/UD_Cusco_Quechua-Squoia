# Summary

Cusco Quechua Squoia treebank is based on the Quehua treebank from the SQUOIA corpus, developed at the University of Zurich. 

# Introduction

The Cusco Quechua Squoia treebank is a conversion of the Quechua portion of the annotated SQUOIA corpus available at https://github.com/a-rios/squoia/tree/master/treebanks. It contains about 2000 annotated sentences. The treebank was converted from XML to CoNLL-U format by Dan Zeman, availble at https://github.com/dan-zeman/squoia/tree/master/treebanks/quz.

## SQUOIA Corpus

The corpus contained three parallel treebanks in Spanish, Cusco Quechua, and German. The majoirity of corpus was translated from Spanish and German to Quechua by native speakers in Peru. One portion (~500 sentences) was originally written in Quechua. 

The corpus contains two chapters of a biography as well as reports about agriculture, development aid, media, culture, education, and economics (Rios, 2015).
